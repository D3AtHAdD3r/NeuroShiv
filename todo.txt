1 - CMakeLists.txt:: create a dedicated function like find_package(CUDAToolkit REQUIRED), 
later once project porting is completed.

2 - Optimizations:: 
- all over the place

3 - Addons::
- add more neurons support(start with ReLU,LeakyReLU,softmax)
- Learning Rate Scheduling: Reduce the learning rate over time to stabilize training and avoid dips.
- Dropout: Add dropout (e.g., 20%) to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- Confusion Matrix: Analyze which digits are misclassified to identify specific weaknesses.
- Add momentum/Adam optimizer for even faster training.
- Transition from dense MLP â†’ simple CNN
